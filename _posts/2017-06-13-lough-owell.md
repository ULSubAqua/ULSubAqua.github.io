A cold, windy day and after a 200km drive to a very small carpark beside a very large lake we discovered one of our intrepid underwater explorers had forgotten his wetsuit. A note to any prospective trainees, you really do need a wetsuit to dive.

Mullingar isn't the first place that springs to mind when you think of diving but it was where we found ourselves thanks to a choppy west coast. After forming a plan of action the first four of our crewmates ventured into the water along the concrete jetty and submerged to find themselves in all of 4 meters of water! One 45 minute dive and about a million crayfish later we emerged and headed straight for the cars for some tea and coffee.

After a quick exchange of wetsuits, the second half of our crew went under, managing to get to the dizzying depth of 8 meters. After an hour long dive through what we believe to have been an underwater meadow this time and yet more crayfish we packed our things and headed on our way, with the customary stop at Supermacs en route. A laid back day in the end with easy diving and good company. And a great feeling to get back in the water, so long as you remember your wetsuit!
